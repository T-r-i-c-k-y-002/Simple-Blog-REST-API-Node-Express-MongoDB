# Simple-Blog-REST-API-Node-Express-MongoDB
Implemented a RESTful API for managing blog posts using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on posts, including creating new posts, updating existing ones, retrieving posts by ID, and deleting posts. Utilized Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling and schema validation.
