# Simple-Blog-REST-API-Node-Express-MongoDB
Implemented a RESTful API for managing blog posts using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on posts, including creating new posts, updating existing ones, retrieving posts by ID, and deleting posts. Utilized Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling and schema validation.

Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose

Achievements:

- Designed and developed a scalable RESTful API following best practices for web development.
- Implemented robust error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- Successfully integrated MongoDB as the database backend for efficient storage and retrieval of blog posts.
- Demonstrated proficiency in asynchronous programming using async/await for handling database operations.
- Collaborated with front-end developers to ensure seamless integration of the API with client-side applications.
