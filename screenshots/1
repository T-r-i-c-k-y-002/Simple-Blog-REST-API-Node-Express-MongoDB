screenshots of both postman and mongoDB 

it displays the content after performing the appropriate operations.

firstly it gets the all posts that are present in db.
next user creates his own post and posts his post and it gets saved in the database.
next if the user want specific post then, after /posts/:id it must contain any id of the post to be displayed.
next similar to :id it gets the id of the post to delete and removes that post from DB.
finally updation comes, if user wants to update the title of the post then with the writen code it performs the update operation neatly.
